## Semester Project in Computer Grafics

In order to pass, the project was supposed to have the the following features:

- Two differently shaped, fully-dimensional 3D objects
  - At least one object must be created using entered coordinates
  - At least one object must either be generated programmatically or read from a file

- Use of transformations (translate, rotate, scale) for simple animations of all objects
  - At least one object should move hierarchically within the local coordinate system of another object

- Different textures in varying resolutions and with different filters
  - Distinct features of mipmapping are recognizable
  - Over-/undersampling is recognizable

- Two different vertex and fragment shaders in the scene
  - Phong shading
  - Texturing using an image file
